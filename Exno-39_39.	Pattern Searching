Pattern searching is an important problem in computer science. When we search for a string in notepad / word file or browser or database, pattern searching algorithms are used to show the results. Finite Automata (FA) can also be used for pattern searching. In FA-based pattern searching algorithm, we preprocess the pattern and build a 2D array that represents a Finite Automata. Construction of the FA is the main tricky part of this algorithm. Once this FA is built, the searching is simple. In search, we simply need to start from the first state of the automata and the first character of the text. At every step, we consider the next character of text, look for the next state in the built FA and move to a new state. If we reach the final state, then the pattern is found in the text. The time complexity of the search process is O(n).
